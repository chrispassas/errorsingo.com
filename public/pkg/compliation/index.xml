      <description>What causes the error? This error means that you are trying to use Go&amp;rsquo;s short form variable declaration (a := &amp;quot;some-value&amp;quot;) when the variable has already been declared.
The most common cause of this compilation error is when you have a variable declared via short form declaration and then add a new line of code before that line which adds a new declaration. This is much clearer with an example.</description>
