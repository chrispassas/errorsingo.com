      <description>What causes the error? If you are here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that you already checked to see if the file exists. If not, go do that now. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait&amp;hellip;
Okay, files there? Great. The most common cause of this error (aside from a file not being present) stems from not understanding how a Go program looks for files. Unlike many languages you may have used in the past, Go opens files relative to where the binary is run from.</description>
