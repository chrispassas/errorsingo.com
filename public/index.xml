      <description>What causes the error? This issue is easily caused by some of the same issues that cause the os.ErrNotExist error. As a result, I suggest you start with the os.ErrNotExist article. Make sure you understand how Go reads opens files relative to where it is run (not relative to where your source code is), and then see if you can figure out the issue.
If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work feel free to reach out - jon@calhoun.</description>

      <description>What causes the error? This error, and many other invalid identifier errors like it, stem from using an invalid character in your Go code. In this particular case, the issue stems from those weird curved quotation marks - “ and ” - which are different from the quotation marks you normally type. An example is shown below.
func main() { // this line cause a compilation error fmt.Println(“test”) }   Run it on the Go Playground → https://play.</description>

      <description>What causes the error? The pq.ErrSSLNotSupported error typically occurs in development when you try to connect to a database without specifying, or with an invalid setting for, the sslmode option in your connection string.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example. Suppose you are using the lib/pq driver and you create your connection string.
connStr := &amp;quot;host=localhost port=5432 user=pquser dbname=some_db&amp;quot; db, err := sql.Open(&amp;quot;postgres&amp;quot;, connStr) if err != nil { // Your code errors here!</description>

      <description>What causes the error? If you are here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that you already checked to see if the file exists. If not, go do that now. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait&amp;hellip;
Okay, files there? Great. The most common cause of this error (aside from a file not being present) stems from not understanding how a Go program looks for files. Unlike many languages you may have used in the past, Go opens files relative to where the binary is run from.</description>
